Approximation of project task

1) from 22 May to 26 May 
-> Voltage rating
-> temperature rating
-> have to learn about the ADCs of MCU
-> Define the functions for LEDControl, getVoltage, getTemperature

2) from 29 May to 29 May 
-> AT commands 
-> work on how to send/receive data from created page
-> how to communicate with STM32
-> also have to implement some functions like: sendVoltage, sendTemp, sendLedstatus, LEDRequests
