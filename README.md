# Project_Repo
Internal Project repo during internship
Project aim:
1) Use STM32 microcontroller to collect voltage rating of 9V Battery, Temperature data from a temperature sensor.
2) send collected data to a web page use esp8266 to use WIFI
3) show the collected data on that same webpage and also provide the buttons to turn ON/OFF the LEDs of STM32 microcontroller
